# Snake Game

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to control the snake to eat apples, which causes it to grow in length. The game ends when the snake collides with the window boundaries or with itself.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation
1. Install Python 3.x if you haven't already. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install the Pygame library by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
    pip install pygame


## Running the Game
1. Save the complete Snake game code provided earlier into a file named `snake_gpt4.py`.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `snake_gpt4.py` file, and run the following command:
    python snake_game.py
The game window should appear, and you can start playing.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) or the W, A, S, D keys to control the snake's movement.
- Navigate the snake to eat the red apples. Each time the snake eats an apple, its length increases.
- Avoid colliding with the window boundaries or the snake's own body.
- The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the window boundaries.
- To restart the game after the "Game Over" screen is shown, press the Enter or Space key.
- To exit the game, press the Escape key or close the game window.

Enjoy the game!
